# Computer-Graphics-Portfolio

Welcome to my Computer Graphics Portfolio repository! Here, you'll find a collection of visually stunning projects showcasing my skills and expertise in computer graphics.

## About

This repository serves as a showcase of my work in the field of computer graphics. Each project demonstrates a unique aspect of my knowledge and proficiency, ranging from 2D and 3D rendering techniques to shader programming and visual effects.

## Why Watch the Videos?

Instead of providing the code directly in this repository, I've chosen to showcase videos and screenshots of my projects. This decision was made to protect the integrity of my work and minimize the risk of plagiarism.

By watching these videos, you'll get a comprehensive overview of each project, including its visual aspects, functionalities, and the creative solutions implemented. Feel free to explore the demos and screenshots provided to get a closer look at the results achieved.

## How to Access the Code

Interested in diving deeper into the code behind these projects? I'm happy to share the code with potential employers and collaborators. Please reach out to me via email at [jingliu597@gmail.com](mailto:jingliu597@gmail.com) to request access to my private repository containing the code.
